# Peter Christian Agbenyega
## Independent Cloud Security Architect & Researcher
This site documents my independent, non-commercial work in cloud security architecture,
focused on improving cybersecurity resilience through open, publicly accessible reference designs.


## Proposed Endeavor
My proposed endeavor is to design and publish scalable cloud security reference architectures
that help organizations improve cybersecurity resilience and reduce cloud misconfiguration risks.

## Areas of Focus

- Cloud security architecture (AWS)
- Infrastructure-as-Code security (Terraform)
- Identity and access management (least privilege)
- Security logging, monitoring, and drift detection
- Secure-by-design reference implementations


## Proof of Work

All technical work is published openly for educational and public-interest purposes:
- GitHub Profile: https://github.com/Peter-Agbenyega
- Public repositories containing cloud security reference architectures
- Architecture diagrams and technical documentation


## Public Benefit

Cloud misconfigurations and security gaps pose significant risks to data protection,
economic stability, and system reliability. This work focuses on making cloud security
best practices more accessible, repeatable, and scalable.
